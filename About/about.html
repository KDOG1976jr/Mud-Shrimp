    <h1><p>Mud shrimp move by walking on the mud's surface using their transporting feet, also known as pereiopods. They can also propel themselves backwards in water using tail muscles and appendages. Mud shrimp are also under an extremelyy major threat. That threat being the extremeley invasive parasitic Isopod Orthione Griffenis. This parasite alone makes the mud shrimp's future outlook look very bleak currently. These parasites like to latch onto the gill chambers of mud shrimp and infect it. This has caused the population of the mud shrimp to declined heavily. </p></h1>
