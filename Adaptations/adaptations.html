    <h1><p><img src="/download.jpg" alt="">Because mud shrimp live in the high tide zone, there are a lot of things they have to deal with. For example, they deal with interupted feeding, due to them being filter feeders, and needing water carrying small plankton and algae for them to eat. Lots of wave action takes place in the high tide zone, which mud shrimp also have to adapt to, along with loss of oxygen and water. How do they deal with this? They burrow up under the sand and mud. Them burrowing allows them to get needed oxygen to survive while waiting for high tide again, along with run from wave action .</p></h1>
